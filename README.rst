A drop-in replacement library for `RPi.GPIO <https://sourceforge.net/projects/raspberry-gpio-python/>`_
for the Orange Pi Zero. Only the basic GPIO functions are replicated,
using sysfs: this allows the GPIO pins to be accessed from user space.

See the `documentation <https://opi-gpio.readthedocs.io>`_ for install
instructions and detailed API usage.
